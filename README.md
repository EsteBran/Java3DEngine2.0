# Java3DEngine2.0

New and better 3D engine made with lwjgl and OpenGL. This engine can parse triangulated obj files and square texture
files and combine them into a mesh. The lighting capabilities include diffuse lighting, specular reflections, directional lights,
and point lights. 

You can move around within a scene using WASD keys for direction, and arrow keys for changing viewing angle. 

Here are some example shots from the current build:
